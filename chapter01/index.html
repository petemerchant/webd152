    <p>My typical morning drink is an Iced Almond Flavored Latte. I must be careful to say “almond flavor” because it will be made with almond milk if I don’t clarify this. I generally only get 2 shots of coffee in a 20-ounce cup because I like to have more than one cup a day. It is a very refreshing drink with enough zing to get your day going.</p>
